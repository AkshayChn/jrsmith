# Akshay for Jay R. Smith

1. I aim for imapct. 
2. I love to work with people. 
3. I've worked with top engineering and research teams.
4. I've worked at prestegious places.

## Here I present my case in four parts:

1. Design
2. Engineering
3. Research
4. AI and machine learning.

# My focus on Design

## This very page

1. This page is based on my pandoc HTML theme. 100% custom HTML-CSS.
2. Reflow and sidebar animations are 100% CSS, no JavaScript.
3. Try the dark mode!
4. Check out my theme code on my [Github Repo](https://github.com/AkshayChn/pandoc-html-theme).
